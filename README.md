## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. It consists of a series of programming puzzles released every day until Christmas. The puzzles cover a wide range of algorithms and programming concepts, making it a great opportunity to improve your coding skills.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized by year starting 2023, with each year containing folders for each day of the Advent of Code event. Inside each day's folder, you'll find solutions implemented in Python and any additional resources or notes.
